### Directory: *resources*

Resources required as inputs to the scripts should be placed in appropriate sub-folders of this directory.
Lone resources which do not warrant a directory to themselves then they can be put in a `./miscellaneous/` directory.

Those running linux (or who know how to do it in windows) can, if they wish, [sym-link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) resources into this directory.
Sadly, windows's *shortcut* files will likely not be interpreted correctly by python (though feel free to prove me wrong!).
