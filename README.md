The main repository for our 2017 hackspace project.

## Project Structure
There are three top level folders:
  - `roboplot` - the top level python package,
  - `scripts` - contains scripts which exercise the `roboplot` package.,
  - `resources` - contains files (e.g. images) which can be used as input to scripts, or for test data, or anything else.
